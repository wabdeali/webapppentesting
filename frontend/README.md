# WAP Project 2021 	:books::computer::laughing::satisfied:

Hi, Web-application for pen-testing  is a Learning application and CyberSecurity Awareness Project that serves the purpose to educate people and provide access to tools, materials, and even an online Operating system :wink: 

We, the creators of this project, hope for everyone to gain knowledge and experience to take a step forward in the field of computer science

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
